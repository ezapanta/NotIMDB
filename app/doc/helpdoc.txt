Welcome to Not IMDB!

Overview:
The home page is where you see all the movies in the database. You can filter the movies by rating or genre or sort them by rating or alphebetically.

By clicking on a movie picture or title, you can see the individual movie page that displays all of that movie's information, trailer, and see purchasing options. 

You can request to add a movie to the database by clicking the "Request Movie Addition" button in the navigation bar. This brings you to a page where you can enter all of the information about a movie and send it to our administrators for approval.
